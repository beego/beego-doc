# Beego 环境

`Beego` depends on the go development environment, and in the current version, `Beego` relies on the `go mod` feature. To install the go environment you can refer to：

- [golang installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

During the development of Beego applications, we will need to use a number of commands:

- [go mod](./go_mod.md)
- [go get](./go_get_command.md)

We also strongly recommend that you use our companion tool `bee`:

- [bee](../bee/README.md)
