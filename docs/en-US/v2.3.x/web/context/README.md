# Web Context

Beego's `Context` object can basically be thought of as representing the entire context in which the web request is processed. Therefore, the `Context` part is all related to input and output, which can be found in:

- [Input](../input/README.md)
- [Output](../output/README.md)
- [File](../file/README.md)
